I have been needing an easy way of recommending episodes of the fantastic Tim Ferriss Show podcast for a while now. What follows is a list of the episodes I found the most value in.

You can see the entire episode list on [the podcast's website](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/).

The easiest way of listening to the episodes is to either go to the [website](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/) and search the episode titles or search on your favourite podcast app. Google will work, also.

Episodes are in the *approximate* order of strength of recommendation.

## Highly Actionable

These podcasts are Tim talking to his audience, often answering up-voted questions or short verbal essays on a particular subject. They are generally shorter and immediately useful and actionable. Pausing and taking notes is highly recommended.
