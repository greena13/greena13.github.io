    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Still Untitled: The Adam Savage podcast was one of the very first that I got into. Its conversational style and the fact that Adam regular answers listeners&#8217; questions makes for a welcoming and engaging listening experience.</p>

<p>Like many long-running, lightly produced podcasts, however, Still Untitled has touched on a great many subjects - some much more interesting than others. Here is a list of my favourite episodes, broken down into two categories.</p>

<h2>Actionable Advice for Creative Work</h2>

<p>Many of these have very similar titles as they involve Adam answering questions from the Tested.com and maker community at large. There is some great advice and inspiration to be found in many of these episodes for creative work. Like <a href="http://greena13.github.io/blog/2016/06/25/the-best-tim-ferriss-show-podcast-episodes/">my Tim Ferriss Podcast recommendations</a>, I would suggest having a pen and paper handy in case you feel the need to take notes.</p>

<p>They are roughly grouped by theme and are not in chronological order, so be prepared to have to listen to five minutes or so of non-sequential preamble at the start of many episodes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Work ethic</li>
<li>Autodidacticism</li>
<li>Getting started making</li>
<li>Where to find stuff</li>
<li>Research tips</li>
<li>Scrounging, buying, finding materials</li>
<li>Skeptics</li>
<li>Shop storage schemes</li>
<li>Questions!</li>
<li>Your questions answered</li>
<li>Building an inexpensive toolkit for beginners</li>
<li>Etsy questions answered</li>
<li>Questions and answers</li>
<li>More questions!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Interesting Stories</h2>

<p>In addition to having a lot of knowledge to impart, Adam has lead a very interesting life. These episodes were particularly engaging stories from his past.</p>

<p>Listen when you want to be enthralled in a good, short story by a cool story or two.</p>

<ul>
<li>Video Games</li>
<li>Practical special effects</li>
<li>Adam&rsquo;s land cruiser</li>
<li>Flying in a U2</li>
<li>Tales of adventure</li>
<li>The significance of billiards</li>
<li>Rainy days</li>
</ul>
