    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been needing an easy way of recommending episodes of the fantastic Tim Ferriss Show podcast for a while now. What follows is a list of the episodes I found the most value in.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>You can see the entire episode list on <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/">the podcast&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>

<p>The easiest way of listening to the episodes is to either go to the <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/">website</a> and search the episode titles or search on your favourite podcast app. Google will work, also.</p>

<p>Episodes are in the <em>approximate</em> order of strength of recommendation.</p>

<h2>Highly Actionable</h2>

<p>These podcasts are Tim talking to his audience, often answering up-voted questions or short verbal essays on a particular subject. They are generally shorter and immediately useful and actionable. Pausing and taking notes is highly recommended.</p>
