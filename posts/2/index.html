  <div class="entry-content"><p>Always in search of productivity gains in my programming work, recently I have been looking into improving my typing speed. I read Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/">We Are Typists First, Programmers Second</a> and was enthused, despite a few commenters pointing out that typing speed is rarely the bottleneck when it comes to coding. Atwood rightly responded that it is a matter of mental &ldquo;bandwidth&rdquo;: ideally, typing should be a function performed entirely autonomously without error or disruption - the mental interference of having to consider which keys should be pressed or what corrective action is needed to rectify a mistype can be detrimental to productivity and creativity. This mirrors a similar sentiment discussed in the highly recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Practice-Perfect-Rules-Getting-Better-ebook/dp/B007ZQ34V4">Practice Perfect</a> by Doug Lemov, Erica Woolway and Katie Yezzi. Lemov and his co-authors discuss practicing monotonous, formulaic and repetitive skills to the point of being able to execute them effortlessly and flawlessly provides more cognitive horsepower for creativity and efficacy.</p>

<p>From working with colleague and peers, I gained the impression I had a pretty average typing speed for a regular computer user and programmer, but I wanted to try and find out a base line. I encountered many figures of average and exceptional typing speeds online, including some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute">rather unbelievable world records</a>, but I could not find any information on the sort typing I was interested in: programming, using just about every key on the keyboard and not just the alphanumeric and punctuation keys. Unable to find the information I wanted, I resigned myself to using what I had. I took a few free typing tests I found online and got an average of about 60 WPM. This is, from what I can gather, above average and more than adequate to produce code efficiently.</p>

<p>However, I knew that my typing speed slowed considerably when I had to code as opposed to writing an email but I was unsure by exactly how much. So I went in search of a tool that might help me find out. I found <a href="https://typing.io/">typing.io</a>, a service that allows you to type code from open source repositories for a number of different languages and frameworks while it measures your typing speed and error rate. Each code excerpt is broken down into chunks called <em>lessons</em>. The free version of the tool was enough to tell me my average typing speed for programming was close to 30 WPM - a rather concerning reduction of 50%. What wasn&rsquo;t available in the free version, however, was exactly which keys it was that was dragging down my typing speed.</p>

<p>I decided to invest in the paid subscription to gain greater access to the lessons and more importantly, to identify which keystrokes were causing me the most problems. I thought if I could find the worst culprits, I could correct the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">fabled 20%</a> and get my 80% improvement.</p>

<p>So, I started working through the lessons and one of the most interesting things I discovered was how I seem to deviated from the prescribed correct finger placements to suit my preferred style of typing. Typing.io provides a virtual keyboard on the bottom of the screen while you are typing, illustrating key placement on your keyboard and the correct fingers that should be used to press it. I have quite long fingers and I oftentimes use this length to my advantage by favouring the longer index and middle fingers to reach keys that are technically designated as the responsibility of the shorter, ring and little fingers.</p>

<p>I wondered if perhaps this overuse of the fingers that sat in the center of the keyboard was contributing to the slower execution of keystrokes attached to keys located towards the outer edge of the board. So within the first 30 minutes of practice, after seeing no improvement in speed - and an increasing error rate as I tried to push myself out of frustration - I decided I would focus on returning to the correct form I had first learnt in highschool to see if it had any effect on my speed.</p>

<p>Initially my error rate soared to around 35%, but gradually it began to come down as I focused on addressing each problem key individually and after more than 11 hours of practice over a period of a week or so, I began to arrive back at levels of ease similar to those I experienced before adjusting my technique and a nice little boost in my speed of 3 - 5 WPM.</p>

<p>After almost 12 hours of use, I had a few observations of typing.io. While the report at the end of each &lsquo;lesson&rsquo; is helpful, it doesn&rsquo;t really tell me what I want to know and can be misleading at times. An infographic of a keyboard is shown and each key is coloured in increasingly warmer colours, with bright red being reserved for the keys you had mistyped the greatest percentage of times. This means that if you typed a key twice and mistyped it once, it appears redder than a key you typed 17 times and mistyped 8 times. This is obviously not useful for identifying the keys that you most often mistype. It would be more useful if data from previous lessons were included as well - perhaps weighted appropriately so the most recent previous lessons had a greater significance.</p>

<p>The infographic also doesn&rsquo;t appear to display any information about how long it takes to press particular keys and therefor where improvement could to be made. It would be further helpful if the tool provided you the top five or ten slowest key transitions, so that you knew which sequences of keys to practice - assuming they occurred frequently enough to justify the effort.</p>

<p>Another gripe is with the virtual keyboard that appears while you are typing, showing you the key and finger combination necessary to achieve the next keystroke. Often I mistyped something and was left confused as to where I had gone wrong; it would have been very helpful if the virtual keyboard had shown what key I had actually pressed so I could correct my form without having to glance down at the actual keyboard.</p>

<p>Typing.io also did not distinguish between which shift key was being pressed and it accepted keystrokes that had been generated with the incorrect shift key. This made it especially difficult to recognise mistakes and correct them because the tool was giving feedback indicating they were correct.</p>

<p>An interesting observation was that the greatest determinant of speed and error rate, was which language I was typing code for. It seems there are languages which lend themselves to be typed much quicker and with less errors. High-level languages with CamelCase variable and method naming conventions were by far the easiest to transcribe. They generally included less operator keystrokes, less opening and closing brackets and none of the dreaded shift + underscore key combination that is so slow and difficult to reach with you little finger. It has left with me with an interesting (but ultimately minor) consideration when selecting suitable languages for future projects.</p>

<p>Overall, this was an curious experience that I would tentatively claim as a measured success. It remains unclear whether adjusting my technique to be more consistent with the suggested finger configurations has improved my typing speed, or whether I just got more accustom to the nuances of the program. I intend to continue with the program with a less intensive regime to see if more clearer results emerge after a longer time period.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The finer points of the different factory design patterns has always escaped me, so I decided to look it up recently and found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4209791/design-patterns-abstract-factory-vs-factory-method">this rather helpful stackoverflow answer</a>. I thought I&rsquo;d summarise what I learnt below (all diagrams were generated using <a href="www.yuml.me">yUML</a>).</p>

<p>A factory design pattern in the most general sense is one that entrusts a class or object with the creation or instantiation of another object. Commonly, the class or object that does the creating is called the Factory object and the object being created is called the Product object. Bare this in mind when viewing the diagrams that follow.</p>

<h2>Static Factories</h2>

<p>A <em>Static Factory</em> is a class that defines a static method that generates various subtypes of a Product. It accepts an argument to determine which Product subtype to generate (shown as a string here, but it could be just about anything). The static factory does not need to be instantiated in order to generate a Product subtype. In some languages, Product&rsquo;s constructor is typically made private so it can only be called within the Product class and thereby prevent the factory from being bypassed.</p>

<p>If the system is later updated and a new Product subtypes is added, the static factory class must be updated to include the new Product subtype.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> I&rsquo;ve used underscore here to indicate a static method as yUML doesn&rsquo;t appear to be able to underline text.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.yuml.me/1e74d10f" alt="Static Factory" /></p>

<h2>Simple Factories</h2>

<p>While static factories define a static method for generating Product subtypes, a <em>Simple Factory</em> is a <em>separate</em> class that defines an <em>instance</em> method to generate instances of Product subtypes. Again, the method typically accepts an argument to indicate which Product subtype to generate. The Product constructor&rsquo;s visibility can be restricted to <em>package</em> if the simple factory and product are packaged together.</p>

<p>The simple factory class must first be instantiated before it can be used to generate a Product instance. Similar to static factories, if a new Product subtype is added, the simple factory class needs to be updated to include it.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.yuml.me/b1f57365" alt="Simple Factory" /></p>

<h2>Factory Method</h2>

<p>A <em>Factory Method</em> class introduces another level of abstraction by defining a <em>Factory Method</em> interface that includes a method to produce Product subtypes. Concrete factory method classes implement this interface and define the factory method to generate Product subtypes related to its (the concrete Factory Method class) own type. Again, you need to create an instance of the concrete Factory Method class before you can create an instance of a Product subtype.</p>

<p>If a new Product subtype is added, each concrete factory method class that needs to be able to generate the new Product subtype, will need to be updated.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.yuml.me/d7f2e8c3" alt="Factory Method" /></p>

<h2>Abstract Factories</h2>

<p>The <em>Abstract Factories</em> is useful when when you have several Product objects that are related conceptually, but not through inheritance. It adds a factory method to the interface for each Product object (each of which has its own set of Product subtypes). It can be thought of as overlapping two or more Factory Methods on top of each other.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Popularised by Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler, <em>Inversion of Control</em> is a design principle where <em>custom code components</em> receive the control flow from general <em>library components</em>, similar to custom code modules being written for a larger general-purpose framework. This is an inversion of the traditional control flow found in <a href="/blog/2014/08/31/procedural-programming">procedural programming</a> where the custom components encode the program&rsquo;s functionality in terms of general purpose libraries. The pattern offers the advantage of making the program more modular and extendable.</p>

<p>Inversion of control is related to Martin&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-programming">dependency inversion principle</a>, which is concerned with having high and low level code depend an abstraction, rather than directly on each other, thereby inverting the direction of dependency. This is analogous to the way high-level, general components yield control to the low-level specific code in Inversion of Control, thereby inverting the traditional flow of control.</p>

<p>Although the term is most often used in the context of object-oriented programming, there are design patterns with wider applications that follow the Inversion of Control principle, such as software frameworks, callbacks and <a href="/blog/2014/09/02/dependency-injection">dependency injection</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Dependency Injection</em> is a software design pattern that works by <em>injecting</em> a reference to a dependency object into a dependent one, where it is stored and made part of the dependent object&rsquo;s state and behaviour. This separates the creation of the dependency object from the dependent object&rsquo;s code. In doing so, it more loosely couples the two objects and abides by the principles of <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-programming">Dependency Inversion</a> (because the dependent object is coupled with the dependency object&rsquo;s interface, rather than directly) and <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-programming">Single Responsibility</a> (because the dependent object is only responsible for its own behaviour, not the creation of the dependency object).</p>

<h2>Design Pattern Elements</h2>

<p>The pattern involves 4 elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency Object</strong>: A concrete dependency object</li>
<li><strong>Dependent Object</strong>: A concrete dependent object that relies on the dependency one</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Interface</strong>: An interface used by the dependent object to communicate with the dependency object</li>
<li><strong>Injector Object</strong>: A concrete injector object responsible for injecting the dependency object into the dependent one</li>
</ul>


<p>The implementation of the Dependency Injection pattern is similar to that of the Strategy pattern, but the semantics differ. The same dependency object is intended to be used for the duration of the dependent object&rsquo;s lifetime, while a strategy often needs to be interchanged throughout an object&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>

<h2>Depdency Injection Techniques</h2>

<p>Martin Fowler defined 3 ways of injecting a dependency:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Constructor Injection</strong>: Dependencies are provided to the dependent object&rsquo;s constructor at the time of creation. This requires the dependency object to be instantiated before the dependent instance and is the preferred method because it avoids the dependent instance ever being in an invalid state. Dependencies injected in this way, however, don&rsquo;t permit the interchanging of the dependency instance.</li>
<li><strong>Setter Injection</strong>: The dependent object provides a setter method that accepts the dependency. This can lead to the problem of needing to make sure the dependency has been set before the dependent object is used; furthermore, it does not explicitly state the relationship between the dependent and dependency object, which is <a href="/blog/2014/08/21/reducing-code-complexity">considered bad practice</a>. It does, however, allow changing the dependency object later in the dependent object&rsquo;s lifetime.</li>
<li><strong>Interface Injection</strong>: The dependency interface provides a method that accepts the dependent object, for the dependency object to inject itself into the dependent object. For this to work, the dependent object must also have a setter method for the dependency object to use to inject itself. This differs from the <em>Setter Injection</em> technique because it goes one step further and makes the dependency object itself a <em>Dependency Injector</em>.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>SOLID</strong> is an acronym mnemonic coined by Michael Feathers for Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;first five principles&rdquo; for object-oriented programming. Each concept is worth looking at briefly so I have tried to summarise the important points of each below.</p>

<h2>Single Responsibility Principle</h2>

<p>Robert C. Martin introduced in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0132760584">Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns and Practices</a> the <em>Single Responsibility Principe</em>, which states code modules (whether they be classes, methods, variables, etc.) should have a single responsibility, or rather a single reason for the module to need updating if a program&rsquo;s specifications were ever to change. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in the separation of <em>presentation</em> and <em>content</em> commonly performed in object-oriented systems.</p>

<h2>Open/Closed Principle</h2>

<p>The <em>Open/Closed Principle</em> has always referred to the fact that modules should &ldquo;be open for extension but closed for modification&rdquo;, but exactly what that meant has had two different interpretations.</p>

<h3>Meyer&rsquo;s Open/Closed Principle</h3>

<p>Bertrand Meyer is attributed with creating the term <em>open/closed principle</em> in the 1988 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Prentice-Hall-Resource/dp/0136291554">Object Oriented Software Construction</a>. Meyer&rsquo;s definition of the rule prescribed that once a module had been coded it should only be altered directly to fix errors - all other modifications should be completed by creating a new class - usually via inheritance to reuse code from the original class. In this form of the open/closed principle, the new class need <em>not</em> reuse the interface of the old class.</p>

<h3>Polymorphic Open/Closed Principle</h3>

<p>In the 1990s the term was largely redefined to refer to the use of abstracted interfaces instead of concrete ones. In contrast to Meyer&rsquo;s version of the principle, concrete classes could be modified and swapped out, so long as the module&rsquo;s <em>interface</em> was closed to modifications. According to the rule, changes or extensions could be performed by altering the concrete implementations freely, so long as the original interface was persisted and only added to.</p>

<p>Where Meyer&rsquo;s principle preserved <em>implementation</em> and allowed for the modification of interfaces, the polymorphic open/closed principle preserves <em>interfaces</em> and allows for the modification of implementations.</p>

<p>Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s article in 1996, <em>The Open-Closed Principle</em>, was instrumental in forwarding this approach and it is the latter definition that is in common use today.</p>

<h2>Liskov Substitution Principle</h2>

<p>The <em>Liskov Substitution Principle</em> put forth by Barbara Liskov&rsquo;s 1987 &lsquo;<em>Data abstraction and hierarchy</em>&rsquo; states that a programmer should be able to substitute an object with an instance of one of its subtypes without altering the surrounding code&rsquo;s behaviour. This is another way of saying that any subtype of an object must completely honour the interface and observable behaviour of its supertype.</p>

<p>To achieve this, a number of requirements must be met that govern the subtype&rsquo;s signature:</p>

<ul>
<li>It must have <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/covariance-and-contravariance">contravariant method arguments</a></li>
<li>It must have <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/covariance-and-contravariance">covariant method return types</a></li>
<li>No new exceptions should be thrown from subtype class&rsquo;s methods other than when they are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by the supertype</li>
</ul>


<p>Beyond maintaining the same interface, a number of behavioural conditions for the subtype must also be satisfied:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preconditions are not to be strengthened in the subtype, i.e. the subtype must not depend on any more prerequisites than its supertype</li>
<li>Postconditions cannot be weakened in the subtype, i.e. the subtype must perform the same behaviour as the supertype</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/covariance-and-contravariance">Method arguments invariants</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/covariance-and-contravariance">method return type invariants</a> of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype</li>
<li>The introduction of new methods cannot allow the subtype to enter a state that would not have been possible in the supertype and thereby change its behaviour; This is often referred to as the <em>History Constraint</em>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Interface Segregation Principle</h2>

<p>The <em>Interface-Segregation Principle</em> states client code should not be able to see any interface points it does not need access to in order to function. Access should be done instead via a <em>role interface</em>, which is tailored to the particular needs of the client code. In short, many specific interfaces are better than a single general purpose one.</p>

<h2>Dependency Inversion Principle</h2>

<p><em>Dependency Inversion</em> is a design pattern that focuses on decoupling software components of different abstractions. Traditionally, high-level components defined functionality in broad strokes and low-level components grew to support the high level code.</p>

<p>Dependency Inversion is based on the notion that rather than having code components with a high level of abstraction depending directly on code components with a low level of abstraction, both components should instead depend on an abstraction. The details of these components should be coded to the abstractions, and not the abstractions to the details.</p>

<p>This design pattern separates the code responsible for connecting the high-level components to the low-level components into an abstract interface, simplifying each component and allowing greater reusability. Often the components are divided into different libraries where the high-level components and interfaces for the functionality needed of the low-level code are bundled together; the low level components are given their own package. Because the interfaces the low-level components implement (and thus depend on) are bundled with the high-level code, the dependency flows up and it is this inversion of dependency direction for which the design pattern gets its name.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have found variance one of the more difficult things to get my head around in computer science, so I have tried to document the basics as a way of teaching myself.</p>

<p><em>Variance</em> in object-oriented programming refers to how subtyping works between complex types. For example, if <em>B</em> is a subtype of <em>A</em> and <em>CA</em> and <em>CB</em> are enumerable collections (our complex types) that contain items of type <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, respectively, is the collection <em>CB</em> a subtype of the collection <em>CA</em>?</p>

<ul>
<li>If the enumerable collection is <strong>covariant</strong> then <em>CB</em> is a subtype of <em>CA</em> and the subtyping relation is said to be <strong>preserved</strong>.</li>
<li>If the enumerable collection is <strong>contravariant</strong> then <em>CB</em> is a subtype of <em>CA</em> and the subtyping relation is said to be <strong>reversed</strong>.</li>
<li>If the enumerable collection is <strong>invariant</strong> then <em>CA</em> and <em>CB</em> are not related by type at all and the subtyping relation is said to be <strong>ignored</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Argument And Return Type Variance</h2>

<p>When inheriting from a parent class and overwriting a method, a programmer is faced with a number of options for the argument and return types of that method, depending on the programming language being used.</p>

<p>Considering the argument type first, programming languages will either offer invariant, contravariant or covariant argument types. A language that offers <em>invariant argument types</em> (C++, Java, C#) requires the arguments of the overriding method to be of the same type as the overridden method. Languages that offer <em>contravariant argument types</em> allow arguments to be supertypes of the overridden method&rsquo;s arguments. Similarly, languages offering <em>covariant argument types</em> permit arguments of subtypes of those for the overridden method.</p>

<p>Return types are much the same; languages offer either covariant (C++, Java) or invariant (C#) return types.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my continuing efforts to clarify fundamental software engineering concepts, I recently read and summarised the most interesting points of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>Functional programming is a <a href="/blog/2014/08/31/imperative-programming-vs-declarative-programming">declarative programming</a> paradigm that treats computations as evaluations of mathematical functions and avoids referencing a system state and mutable data. It was developed, primarily, as an attempt to avoid side effects and make subroutines much easier to reason about. It introduces a number of interesting and useful concepts that are not often encountered or emphasised in object-orient programming.</p>

<h2>Pure Functions</h2>

<p>Pure functions are those that have no side effects and depend only on their argument values, not on any system information; consequently, they return the same value for a given set of parameter values every time. They have some unique properties useful for code optimisation and reasoning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the result of a pure expression is not used, it can be removed without altering the code&rsquo;s behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>If a pure function is called with arguments that are themselves pure functions, or don&rsquo;t have side effects, then the result can be cached and returned if the function is called with the same parameter values again.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no dependency amongst a collection of functions, they can be run in any order with the same result.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Referential Transparency</h2>

<p>Referential transparency is a property of code that refers to whether or not it can be replaced with its calculated value without changing its behaviour. If this is indeed the case, the code is said to be <em>referentially transparent</em>; if the code cannot be replaced with its value without altering system behaviour then it is <em>referentially opaque</em>.</p>

<p>All pure function calls are referentially transparent as they do not depend on or change system behaviour and should always return the same result when given the same arguments.</p>

<h2>First-class Functions</h2>

<p>First-class functions are those which can appear anywhere in a program that other first-class entities (such as numbers) can. This notably includes as arguments and return values for other functions. They can also accept and return other functions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently reading the Wikipedia articles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative programming</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative programming</a> to brush up on my understanding of the distinction.</p>

<h2>Imperative Programming</h2>

<p>Imperative programming is concerned with describing how a program should achieve its functionality; not only <em>what</em> should be done, but also <em>how</em> it should be done is encoded. The movement of data and execution of operations are explicitly specified, if only at an abstract level; that is to say, an imperative program is concerned with implementation as much as it is logic functionality.</p>

<p>Imperative programming has its roots in assembly language and machine code, however, modern high-level languages offer more human-friendly syntax and aggregate functionality. <a href="/blog/2014/08/31/procedural-programming">Procedural programming</a> is a common paradigm that falls within imperative programming.</p>

<h2>Declarative Programming</h2>

<p>Declarative programming focuses on expressing the logic of a computation without needing to specify it in terms of low-level operations. Declarative programming emerged out of an attempt to minimise side-effects and focus on a program&rsquo;s primary function, leaving the implementation details to the language itself.</p>

<p>Common examples of declarative programming are SQL, regular expressions and functional programming.</p>

<p>It seems the difference between the two programming ideologies is largely concerned with the distribution of responsibility: in imperative programming the programmer is responsible for specifying logic functionality and implementation details while in declarative programming the language takes ownership of the implementation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been recently trying to improve my understanding of some of the fundamental concepts in computer science. I looked at <em>procedural programming</em> this time and attempted to extract the important points of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>Procedural programming is derived from <a href="/blog/2014/08/30/structured-programming">structured programming</a> and based on the concept of a procedure being a sequence of steps to be executed to achieve a reported goal. In this respect, procedural languages are also imperative languages because they contain not only what to do, but how to do it, by referencing the system state.</p>

<p>Structurally, there is considerable overlap between procedural programming and functional programming as they both originate in structured programming. Functional programs have <em>functions</em> as their routines while procedural programs have <em>procedures</em>. The intent behind functional languages is different, however, as most of the imperative elements are removed or made second-class citizens and functional control constructs are used instead. Procedural languages model programs as a list of imperative commands that may alter a system&rsquo;s state. Functional languages, on the other hand, are designed to support <em>pure functions</em>, or routines that depend <em>only on their inputs</em> and nothing else, and which <em>do not</em> alter the system state.</p>

<p>Procedural programming differs from object-oriented in the way data and functionality are bundled. Procedural programming deals with variables, data structures and subroutines; object-oriented programming uses objects that expose behaviour (methods) and data (attributes) via interfaces. In procedural programming, procedures operate on data structures while in object-oriented programming methods and data attributes are bundled together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been recently trying to get a better handle on some terms I possess a casual understanding of and use regularly in conversation, but suspect I don&rsquo;t really have a full appreciation for. <em>Structured programming</em> was the first of these terms. What follows is a summary of the more interesting bits of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<h2>Structured Programming</h2>

<p>Structured programming emerged, at least in part, from the Edsger Dijkstra&rsquo;s paper &lsquo;<em>GOTO Considered Harmful</em>&rsquo;, warning of the propensity for the <code>goto</code> control statement to lead to <em>Spaghetti Code</em>.</p>

<h3>Structured Programming Theory</h3>

<p>Structured program theory offers 3 ways of connecting statements, which are sufficient to express any computable function, or all of the operations of a <em>Turing Machine</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>As <strong>Sequences</strong>: sequentially executed statements and subroutines</li>
<li>As <strong>Selections</strong>: conditionally executed statements and subroutines, depending on system state</li>
<li>As <strong>Iterations</strong>: repeatedly executed statements and subroutines until some system state is achieved or all members of a collection are exhausted</li>
</ul>


<h3>Structured Programming</h3>

<p>Structured programming implements the 3 ways of connecting statements using 3 control structures:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Subroutines</strong>: groupings of code that can be evoked using a single statement, eg. procedures, functions or methods</li>
<li><strong>Block Structures</strong>: collection of statements evoked together under the same conditions, eg. blocks designated with <code>if</code> and <code>end</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Loops</strong>: collection of statements that are evoked repeatedly together until a particular state is reached, eg <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Single Exit Point Rule</h3>

<p>Structured programming advocates a single entry and exit point for each subroutine to make reasoning about them easier and reduce the potential for particular types of bugs to occur. Many have argued trying to abide by this principle can add unnecessary complexity and many programming languages facilitate subroutines with multiple exit points, eg. <code>return</code>, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>.</p>

<p>When coding subroutines with multiple exits, care must be taken to ensure that cleanup code is run at the end of all execution paths (think of the <code>finally</code> block provided by some programming languages for exception handling).</p>

<p>The computer scientist David Watt considered the justification for avoiding <code>goto</code> statements (Watts termed them <em>jump sequencers</em>) in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Concepts-Computer-Science/dp/0470853204">his textbook</a>. He suggests <code>goto</code> are harmful to the understandability of code because the reader must first go to the memory address or subroutine definition to find out the intent behind the jump; however, Watt argues the intent behind what he terms <em>escape sequencers</em> (<code>return</code>, <code>continue</code> and <code>break</code>) is much clearer and therefore do not create the same problem.</p>

<h3>Exception Handling</h3>

<p>Exceptions pose a particular challenge for trying to abide by the single exit point rule. Watts notes that <em>exception sequencers</em> usually need the exception handler to reside at a more contextually aware area of the code, away from the low-level code where it occurs (the exception is <em>thrown</em> or <em>raised</em>). Kenneth Louden and Lambert add in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Languages-Principles-Kenneth-Louden/dp/1111529418">their textbook</a> that exception handling is not structured programming because the setup of control and the actual transfer of control happen in different places in the code. Furthermore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming#cite_note-Bansal2013-13">it has been noted by some</a> that exceptions can even cause control structures that would normally conform to the single exit rule to violate it: for example, a <code>for</code> loop where an exception is thrown in the instantiation of the first iteration - the loop would not get to run and exit as intended.</p>

<h3>Single Entry Point Rule</h3>

<p>Routines can also have multiple entry points and violate the single entry rule, most notably as re-entry into a <em>coroutine</em>; this happens when a subroutine yields control to another but maintains its own state and can be resumed where it was left off. This has applications in input/output and network streams as well as concurrency and state machines in general.</p>
