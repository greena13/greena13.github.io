  <div class="entry-content"><p>The finer points of the different factory design patterns has always escaped me, so I decided to look it up recently and found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4209791/design-patterns-abstract-factory-vs-factory-method">this rather helpful stackoverflow answer</a>. I thought I&rsquo;d summarise what I learnt below (all diagrams were generated using <a href="www.yuml.me">yUML</a>).</p>

<p>A factory design pattern in the most general sense is one that entrusts a class or object with the creation or instantiation of another object. Commonly, the class or object that does the creating is called the Factory object and the object being created is called the Product object. Bare this in mind when viewing the diagrams that follow.</p>

<h2>Static Factories</h2>

<p>A <em>Static Factory</em> is a class that defines a static method that generates various subtypes of a Product. It accepts an argument to determine which Product subtype to generate (shown as a string here, but it could be just about anything). The static factory does not need to be instantiated in order to generate a Product subtype. In some languages, Product&rsquo;s constructor is typically made private so it can only be called within the Product class and thereby prevent the factory from being bypassed.</p>

<p>If the system is later updated and a new Product subtypes is added, the static factory class must be updated to include the new Product subtype.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> I&rsquo;ve used underscore here to indicate a static method as yUML doesn&rsquo;t appear to be able to underline text.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.yuml.me/1e74d10f" alt="Static Factory" /></p>

<h2>Simple Factories</h2>

<p>While static factories define a static method for generating Product subtypes, a <em>Simple Factory</em> is a <em>separate</em> class that defines an <em>instance</em> method to generate instances of Product subtypes. Again, the method typically accepts an argument to indicate which Product subtype to generate. The Product constructor&rsquo;s visibility can be restricted to <em>package</em> if the simple factory and product are packaged together.</p>

<p>The simple factory class must first be instantiated before it can be used to generate a Product instance. Similar to static factories, if a new Product subtype is added, the simple factory class needs to be updated to include it.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.yuml.me/b1f57365" alt="Simple Factory" /></p>

<h2>Factory Method</h2>

<p>A <em>Factory Method</em> class introduces another level of abstraction by defining a <em>Factory Method</em> interface that includes a method to produce Product subtypes. Concrete factory method classes implement this interface and define the factory method to generate Product subtypes related to its (the concrete Factory Method class) own type. Again, you need to create an instance of the concrete Factory Method class before you can create an instance of a Product subtype.</p>

<p>If a new Product subtype is added, each concrete factory method class that needs to be able to generate the new Product subtype, will need to be updated.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.yuml.me/d7f2e8c3" alt="Factory Method" /></p>

<h2>Abstract Factories</h2>

<p>The <em>Abstract Factories</em> is useful when when you have several Product objects that are related conceptually, but not through inheritance. It adds a factory method to the interface for each Product object (each of which has its own set of Product subtypes). It can be thought of as overlapping two or more Factory Methods on top of each other.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Popularised by Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler, <em>Inversion of Control</em> is a design principle where <em>custom code components</em> receive the control flow from general <em>library components</em>, similar to custom code modules being written for a larger general-purpose framework. This is an inversion of the traditional control flow found in <a href="/blog/2014/08/31/procedural-programming">procedural programming</a> where the custom components encode the program&rsquo;s functionality in terms of general purpose libraries. The pattern offers the advantage of making the program more modular and extendable.</p>

<p>Inversion of control is related to Martin&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-programming">dependency inversion principle</a>, which is concerned with having high and low level code depend an abstraction, rather than directly on each other, thereby inverting the direction of dependency. This is analogous to the way high-level, general components yield control to the low-level specific code in Inversion of Control, thereby inverting the traditional flow of control.</p>

<p>Although the term is most often used in the context of object-oriented programming, there are design patterns with wider applications that follow the Inversion of Control principle, such as software frameworks, callbacks and <a href="/blog/2014/09/02/dependency-injection">dependency injection</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Dependency Injection</em> is a software design pattern that works by <em>injecting</em> a reference to a dependency object into a dependent one, where it is stored and made part of the dependent object&rsquo;s state and behaviour. This separates the creation of the dependency object from the dependent object&rsquo;s code. In doing so, it more loosely couples the two objects and abides by the principles of <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-programming">Dependency Inversion</a> (because the dependent object is coupled with the dependency object&rsquo;s interface, rather than directly) and <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-programming">Single Responsibility</a> (because the dependent object is only responsible for its own behaviour, not the creation of the dependency object).</p>

<h2>Design Pattern Elements</h2>

<p>The pattern involves 4 elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency Object</strong>: A concrete dependency object</li>
<li><strong>Dependent Object</strong>: A concrete dependent object that relies on the dependency one</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Interface</strong>: An interface used by the dependent object to communicate with the dependency object</li>
<li><strong>Injector Object</strong>: A concrete injector object responsible for injecting the dependency object into the dependent one</li>
</ul>


<p>The implementation of the Dependency Injection pattern is similar to that of the Strategy pattern, but the semantics differ. The same dependency object is intended to be used for the duration of the dependent object&rsquo;s lifetime, while a strategy often needs to be interchanged throughout an object&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>

<h2>Depdency Injection Techniques</h2>

<p>Martin Fowler defined 3 ways of injecting a dependency:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Constructor Injection</strong>: Dependencies are provided to the dependent object&rsquo;s constructor at the time of creation. This requires the dependency object to be instantiated before the dependent instance and is the preferred method because it avoids the dependent instance ever being in an invalid state. Dependencies injected in this way, however, don&rsquo;t permit the interchanging of the dependency instance.</li>
<li><strong>Setter Injection</strong>: The dependent object provides a setter method that accepts the dependency. This can lead to the problem of needing to make sure the dependency has been set before the dependent object is used; furthermore, it does not explicitly state the relationship between the dependent and dependency object, which is <a href="/blog/2014/08/21/reducing-code-complexity">considered bad practice</a>. It does, however, allow changing the dependency object later in the dependent object&rsquo;s lifetime.</li>
<li><strong>Interface Injection</strong>: The dependency interface provides a method that accepts the dependent object, for the dependency object to inject itself into the dependent object. For this to work, the dependent object must also have a setter method for the dependency object to use to inject itself. This differs from the <em>Setter Injection</em> technique because it goes one step further and makes the dependency object itself a <em>Dependency Injector</em>.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>SOLID</strong> is an acronym mnemonic coined by Michael Feathers for Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;first five principles&rdquo; for object-oriented programming. Each concept is worth looking at briefly so I have tried to summarise the important points of each below.</p>

<h2>Single Responsibility Principle</h2>

<p>Robert C. Martin introduced in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0132760584">Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns and Practices</a> the <em>Single Responsibility Principe</em>, which states code modules (whether they be classes, methods, variables, etc.) should have a single responsibility, or rather a single reason for the module to need updating if a program&rsquo;s specifications were ever to change. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in the separation of <em>presentation</em> and <em>content</em> commonly performed in object-oriented systems.</p>

<h2>Open/Closed Principle</h2>

<p>The <em>Open/Closed Principle</em> has always referred to the fact that modules should &ldquo;be open for extension but closed for modification&rdquo;, but exactly what that meant has had two different interpretations.</p>

<h3>Meyer&rsquo;s Open/Closed Principle</h3>

<p>Bertrand Meyer is attributed with creating the term <em>open/closed principle</em> in the 1988 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Prentice-Hall-Resource/dp/0136291554">Object Oriented Software Construction</a>. Meyer&rsquo;s definition of the rule prescribed that once a module had been coded it should only be altered directly to fix errors - all other modifications should be completed by creating a new class - usually via inheritance to reuse code from the original class. In this form of the open/closed principle, the new class need <em>not</em> reuse the interface of the old class.</p>

<h3>Polymorphic Open/Closed Principle</h3>

<p>In the 1990s the term was largely redefined to refer to the use of abstracted interfaces instead of concrete ones. In contrast to Meyer&rsquo;s version of the principle, concrete classes could be modified and swapped out, so long as the module&rsquo;s <em>interface</em> was closed to modifications. According to the rule, changes or extensions could be performed by altering the concrete implementations freely, so long as the original interface was persisted and only added to.</p>

<p>Where Meyer&rsquo;s principle preserved <em>implementation</em> and allowed for the modification of interfaces, the polymorphic open/closed principle preserves <em>interfaces</em> and allows for the modification of implementations.</p>

<p>Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s article in 1996, <em>The Open-Closed Principle</em>, was instrumental in forwarding this approach and it is the latter definition that is in common use today.</p>

<h2>Liskov Substitution Principle</h2>

<p>The <em>Liskov Substitution Principle</em> put forth by Barbara Liskov&rsquo;s 1987 &lsquo;<em>Data abstraction and hierarchy</em>&rsquo; states that a programmer should be able to substitute an object with an instance of one of its subtypes without altering the surrounding code&rsquo;s behaviour. This is another way of saying that any subtype of an object must completely honour the interface and observable behaviour of its supertype.</p>

<p>To achieve this, a number of requirements must be met that govern the subtype&rsquo;s signature:</p>

<ul>
<li>It must have <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/covariance-and-contravariance">contravariant method arguments</a></li>
<li>It must have <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/covariance-and-contravariance">covariant method return types</a></li>
<li>No new exceptions should be thrown from subtype class&rsquo;s methods other than when they are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by the supertype</li>
</ul>


<p>Beyond maintaining the same interface, a number of behavioural conditions for the subtype must also be satisfied:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preconditions are not to be strengthened in the subtype, i.e. the subtype must not depend on any more prerequisites than its supertype</li>
<li>Postconditions cannot be weakened in the subtype, i.e. the subtype must perform the same behaviour as the supertype</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/covariance-and-contravariance">Method arguments invariants</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/09/01/covariance-and-contravariance">method return type invariants</a> of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype</li>
<li>The introduction of new methods cannot allow the subtype to enter a state that would not have been possible in the supertype and thereby change its behaviour; This is often referred to as the <em>History Constraint</em>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Interface Segregation Principle</h2>

<p>The <em>Interface-Segregation Principle</em> states client code should not be able to see any interface points it does not need access to in order to function. Access should be done instead via a <em>role interface</em>, which is tailored to the particular needs of the client code. In short, many specific interfaces are better than a single general purpose one.</p>

<h2>Dependency Inversion Principle</h2>

<p><em>Dependency Inversion</em> is a design pattern that focuses on decoupling software components of different abstractions. Traditionally, high-level components defined functionality in broad strokes and low-level components grew to support the high level code.</p>

<p>Dependency Inversion is based on the notion that rather than having code components with a high level of abstraction depending directly on code components with a low level of abstraction, both components should instead depend on an abstraction. The details of these components should be coded to the abstractions, and not the abstractions to the details.</p>

<p>This design pattern separates the code responsible for connecting the high-level components to the low-level components into an abstract interface, simplifying each component and allowing greater reusability. Often the components are divided into different libraries where the high-level components and interfaces for the functionality needed of the low-level code are bundled together; the low level components are given their own package. Because the interfaces the low-level components implement (and thus depend on) are bundled with the high-level code, the dependency flows up and it is this inversion of dependency direction for which the design pattern gets its name.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have found variance one of the more difficult things to get my head around in computer science, so I have tried to document the basics as a way of teaching myself.</p>

<p><em>Variance</em> in object-oriented programming refers to how subtyping works between complex types. For example, if <em>B</em> is a subtype of <em>A</em> and <em>CA</em> and <em>CB</em> are enumerable collections (our complex types) that contain items of type <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, respectively, is the collection <em>CB</em> a subtype of the collection <em>CA</em>?</p>

<ul>
<li>If the enumerable collection is <strong>covariant</strong> then <em>CB</em> is a subtype of <em>CA</em> and the subtyping relation is said to be <strong>preserved</strong>.</li>
<li>If the enumerable collection is <strong>contravariant</strong> then <em>CB</em> is a subtype of <em>CA</em> and the subtyping relation is said to be <strong>reversed</strong>.</li>
<li>If the enumerable collection is <strong>invariant</strong> then <em>CA</em> and <em>CB</em> are not related by type at all and the subtyping relation is said to be <strong>ignored</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Argument And Return Type Variance</h2>

<p>When inheriting from a parent class and overwriting a method, a programmer is faced with a number of options for the argument and return types of that method, depending on the programming language being used.</p>

<p>Considering the argument type first, programming languages will either offer invariant, contravariant or covariant argument types. A language that offers <em>invariant argument types</em> (C++, Java, C#) requires the arguments of the overriding method to be of the same type as the overridden method. Languages that offer <em>contravariant argument types</em> allow arguments to be supertypes of the overridden method&rsquo;s arguments. Similarly, languages offering <em>covariant argument types</em> permit arguments of subtypes of those for the overridden method.</p>

<p>Return types are much the same; languages offer either covariant (C++, Java) or invariant (C#) return types.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my continuing efforts to clarify fundamental software engineering concepts, I recently read and summarised the most interesting points of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>Functional programming is a <a href="/blog/2014/08/31/imperative-programming-vs-declarative-programming">declarative programming</a> paradigm that treats computations as evaluations of mathematical functions and avoids referencing a system state and mutable data. It was developed, primarily, as an attempt to avoid side effects and make subroutines much easier to reason about. It introduces a number of interesting and useful concepts that are not often encountered or emphasised in object-orient programming.</p>

<h2>Pure Functions</h2>

<p>Pure functions are those that have no side effects and depend only on their argument values, not on any system information; consequently, they return the same value for a given set of parameter values every time. They have some unique properties useful for code optimisation and reasoning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the result of a pure expression is not used, it can be removed without altering the code&rsquo;s behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>If a pure function is called with arguments that are themselves pure functions, or don&rsquo;t have side effects, then the result can be cached and returned if the function is called with the same parameter values again.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no dependency amongst a collection of functions, they can be run in any order with the same result.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Referential Transparency</h2>

<p>Referential transparency is a property of code that refers to whether or not it can be replaced with its calculated value without changing its behaviour. If this is indeed the case, the code is said to be <em>referentially transparent</em>; if the code cannot be replaced with its value without altering system behaviour then it is <em>referentially opaque</em>.</p>

<p>All pure function calls are referentially transparent as they do not depend on or change system behaviour and should always return the same result when given the same arguments.</p>

<h2>First-class Functions</h2>

<p>First-class functions are those which can appear anywhere in a program that other first-class entities (such as numbers) can. This notably includes as arguments and return values for other functions. They can also accept and return other functions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently reading the Wikipedia articles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative programming</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative programming</a> to brush up on my understanding of the distinction.</p>

<h2>Imperative Programming</h2>

<p>Imperative programming is concerned with describing how a program should achieve its functionality; not only <em>what</em> should be done, but also <em>how</em> it should be done is encoded. The movement of data and execution of operations are explicitly specified, if only at an abstract level; that is to say, an imperative program is concerned with implementation as much as it is logic functionality.</p>

<p>Imperative programming has its roots in assembly language and machine code, however, modern high-level languages offer more human-friendly syntax and aggregate functionality. <a href="/blog/2014/08/31/procedural-programming">Procedural programming</a> is a common paradigm that falls within imperative programming.</p>

<h2>Declarative Programming</h2>

<p>Declarative programming focuses on expressing the logic of a computation without needing to specify it in terms of low-level operations. Declarative programming emerged out of an attempt to minimise side-effects and focus on a program&rsquo;s primary function, leaving the implementation details to the language itself.</p>

<p>Common examples of declarative programming are SQL, regular expressions and functional programming.</p>

<p>It seems the difference between the two programming ideologies is largely concerned with the distribution of responsibility: in imperative programming the programmer is responsible for specifying logic functionality and implementation details while in declarative programming the language takes ownership of the implementation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been recently trying to improve my understanding of some of the fundamental concepts in computer science. I looked at <em>procedural programming</em> this time and attempted to extract the important points of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>Procedural programming is derived from <a href="/blog/2014/08/30/structured-programming">structured programming</a> and based on the concept of a procedure being a sequence of steps to be executed to achieve a reported goal. In this respect, procedural languages are also imperative languages because they contain not only what to do, but how to do it, by referencing the system state.</p>

<p>Structurally, there is considerable overlap between procedural programming and functional programming as they both originate in structured programming. Functional programs have <em>functions</em> as their routines while procedural programs have <em>procedures</em>. The intent behind functional languages is different, however, as most of the imperative elements are removed or made second-class citizens and functional control constructs are used instead. Procedural languages model programs as a list of imperative commands that may alter a system&rsquo;s state. Functional languages, on the other hand, are designed to support <em>pure functions</em>, or routines that depend <em>only on their inputs</em> and nothing else, and which <em>do not</em> alter the system state.</p>

<p>Procedural programming differs from object-oriented in the way data and functionality are bundled. Procedural programming deals with variables, data structures and subroutines; object-oriented programming uses objects that expose behaviour (methods) and data (attributes) via interfaces. In procedural programming, procedures operate on data structures while in object-oriented programming methods and data attributes are bundled together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been recently trying to get a better handle on some terms I possess a casual understanding of and use regularly in conversation, but suspect I don&rsquo;t really have a full appreciation for. <em>Structured programming</em> was the first of these terms. What follows is a summary of the more interesting bits of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<h2>Structured Programming</h2>

<p>Structured programming emerged, at least in part, from the Edsger Dijkstra&rsquo;s paper &lsquo;<em>GOTO Considered Harmful</em>&rsquo;, warning of the propensity for the <code>goto</code> control statement to lead to <em>Spaghetti Code</em>.</p>

<h3>Structured Programming Theory</h3>

<p>Structured program theory offers 3 ways of connecting statements, which are sufficient to express any computable function, or all of the operations of a <em>Turing Machine</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>As <strong>Sequences</strong>: sequentially executed statements and subroutines</li>
<li>As <strong>Selections</strong>: conditionally executed statements and subroutines, depending on system state</li>
<li>As <strong>Iterations</strong>: repeatedly executed statements and subroutines until some system state is achieved or all members of a collection are exhausted</li>
</ul>


<h3>Structured Programming</h3>

<p>Structured programming implements the 3 ways of connecting statements using 3 control structures:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Subroutines</strong>: groupings of code that can be evoked using a single statement, eg. procedures, functions or methods</li>
<li><strong>Block Structures</strong>: collection of statements evoked together under the same conditions, eg. blocks designated with <code>if</code> and <code>end</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Loops</strong>: collection of statements that are evoked repeatedly together until a particular state is reached, eg <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Single Exit Point Rule</h3>

<p>Structured programming advocates a single entry and exit point for each subroutine to make reasoning about them easier and reduce the potential for particular types of bugs to occur. Many have argued trying to abide by this principle can add unnecessary complexity and many programming languages facilitate subroutines with multiple exit points, eg. <code>return</code>, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>.</p>

<p>When coding subroutines with multiple exits, care must be taken to ensure that cleanup code is run at the end of all execution paths (think of the <code>finally</code> block provided by some programming languages for exception handling).</p>

<p>The computer scientist David Watt considered the justification for avoiding <code>goto</code> statements (Watts termed them <em>jump sequencers</em>) in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Concepts-Computer-Science/dp/0470853204">his textbook</a>. He suggests <code>goto</code> are harmful to the understandability of code because the reader must first go to the memory address or subroutine definition to find out the intent behind the jump; however, Watt argues the intent behind what he terms <em>escape sequencers</em> (<code>return</code>, <code>continue</code> and <code>break</code>) is much clearer and therefore do not create the same problem.</p>

<h3>Exception Handling</h3>

<p>Exceptions pose a particular challenge for trying to abide by the single exit point rule. Watts notes that <em>exception sequencers</em> usually need the exception handler to reside at a more contextually aware area of the code, away from the low-level code where it occurs (the exception is <em>thrown</em> or <em>raised</em>). Kenneth Louden and Lambert add in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Languages-Principles-Kenneth-Louden/dp/1111529418">their textbook</a> that exception handling is not structured programming because the setup of control and the actual transfer of control happen in different places in the code. Furthermore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming#cite_note-Bansal2013-13">it has been noted by some</a> that exceptions can even cause control structures that would normally conform to the single exit rule to violate it: for example, a <code>for</code> loop where an exception is thrown in the instantiation of the first iteration - the loop would not get to run and exit as intended.</p>

<h3>Single Entry Point Rule</h3>

<p>Routines can also have multiple entry points and violate the single entry rule, most notably as re-entry into a <em>coroutine</em>; this happens when a subroutine yields control to another but maintains its own state and can be resumed where it was left off. This has applications in input/output and network streams as well as concurrency and state machines in general.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have already written on <a href="blog/2014/08/26/creating-cards-for-spaced-repetition">tips for creating spaced repetition cards</a>, but here I hope to summarise a few of Jack Kinsella&rsquo;s tips specific to <a href="http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html">memorising programming languages</a> (and <a href="http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk/articles/janki_method_refined">here</a> also).</p>

<h2>Use Screenshots</h2>

<p>Rather than typing out code manually onto your cards, screenshots should be used. Aside from the obvious and significant time saving, screenshots provide you with syntax highlighting with no additional effort, creating a richer image for the brain to process and remember, with the salient parts already highlighted. Kinsella also claims - perhaps rightly so - that taking screenshots of the original source may draw upon situational memory to help aid in recollection.</p>

<h2>Focus on What&rsquo;s Available - Not How to Use It</h2>

<p>When you are committing functions and methods to memory, focus on what they are called and what they do rather than concerning yourself with details of parameter order and return types. When you come to committing a second or third language to memory, this information will likely become conflicting content and cause you endless problems as you recall information for the wrong language.</p>

<p>When you sit down to program, what is of greatest use is what functions or methods are available in the language. This is to avoid naively reimplementing functionality already on offer, or recreating an existing and well-known solution. Once you know what functions you wish to use, a decent IDE will help you out with the rest.</p>

<h2>Make Clear What is Language Agnostic</h2>

<p>Often there are functions and methods with the same or similar names and functionality offered by different languages and libraries. Make sure to encode what these functions are, and any differences they may have between languages. It is often helpful to define other language&rsquo;s implementations relative to one you are already very familiar with.</p>

<h2>Create Cards From Good Code</h2>

<p>When you encounter a good piece of code - perhaps from a well-maintained open source repository or a well-reviewed tutorial - create cards from it and quiz yourself on its merits, or even pitfalls if you are able to find them. This will help with you ability to read and analyse code and will impart good practices with concrete examples.</p>

<h2>Process Information Can Be Difficult to Encode</h2>

<p>Processes and ordered information is difficult to store and remember in Anki because it suffers from the same problems as sets and enumerations. The process should be encoded as clozed deletions, or care should be taken to encoding a clear link between each step in the process.</p>
